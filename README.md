# Job-Assistent
Problem Statement: The Employment Department at present has a digital platform www.pgrkam.com and its mobile application to provide almost all services offered to job seekers and employers through digital means. The portal has multiple modules like private sector jobs, government jobs, self-employment avenues, foreign jobs, foreign study, counseling, guidance, induction into armed forces, job melas, etc. Currently, when a user visits the portal/app, there is no hand-holding mechanism to help the user get to the part of the digital platform which will resolve his queries. The user is required to navigate across multiple modules on the portal/ app to search for answers.
